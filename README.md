TimeStack
=========

TimeStack. A Mac OS X status bar (NSStatusItem) time tracking application which integrates with a company time management API using the <a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking" target="_blank">AFNetworking 2.0</a> networking library.

## Requirements to build:

- Mac OS X 10.8+
- Apple Xcode 5+
- AFNetworking 2.0 (included)

#### Note:

This repository is provided simply as a learning resource for anyone looking to build their own Mac OS X status bar application. I did not manage to find many resources available on this subject when I started out. This tool is the result of my first stab at an Objective-C Mac OS X application. As this was an iterative learning process I'm sure there are many things that can be improved upon. Although I'll do my best to keep it up to date, there are no guarantees of full functionality. At present it will not work without an API key. I will add some dummy example data when I find time.
